            I'm not going to annoy you with such page on every minor update but only if there is something important to say.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the first WebExtensions (Firefox 57+ compatible) version and there are some things that won't work as they used to work before:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It isn't possible to process some pages anymore. In particular: all Firefox internal pages (about:preferences, about:addons, about:config, etc), other add-ons internal pages, and addons.mozilla.org. Extension will tell you that "Modification of this page is not available due to Firefox restrictions" in it's pop-up in such cases. We have to live with that.
            </li>
            <li>
                On tab switching and on new page loading there are possible white screen flashes. I'm working on finding a way to eliminate this.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
